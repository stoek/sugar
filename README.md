# What is this?
This is me experimenting writing my own interpeter in go, based on a book explaining just that. 
I have tried to be orginal and called the lang it interprets "Sugar". 
Which means that any syntax is a syntax sugar ;) 
## Note
Not that anyone will, cause it misses a gazillion features, but this should not be used for quite literally anything.
